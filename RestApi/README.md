## Add new employee using postman
New employee data is transferred through an HTTP request body carrying employee data as a json. This request gets sent to a servlet that calls the addEmployee api.
json date from request body gets mapped to a java object that gets stored in the SQL database. Using JPA and hibernate that are built in springboot

- no id has to be sent. employee id is autogenerated
  ```
  "employee":{"id":1},
  "position":{"id":1},
  "department":{"id":1}
  ```
